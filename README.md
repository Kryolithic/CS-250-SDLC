1) In order to identify the user needs, you must identify what goals the user is trying to accomplish. The User Stories help with this because each story breaks a large idea down into tangible outcomes for the intended user. These tangible outcomes represent the end goals for the desired product.
2) My approach in developing programs starts with identifying the intended outcome. I will then logically trace the steps using methods such as flowcharts and psuedocode to help paint the intitial picture for the development process. During this process, I will use all tools available to me including the most important of all: communication. The agile process lays out a framework for the flexible and communication driven development that is desired. Agile tools such as the daily scrum and the product backlog will help the team I am working with remain organized, on point, and adaptable.
3) As communication forms the cornerstone of the modern, fast paced software development process; being an excellent team member is paramount to success. The team must support eachother as well as clearly communicate their intentions. The environment must remain positive even in the face of adversity and the team lives together and dies together (metaphorically speaking :) ).
